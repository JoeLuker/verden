# Verden
A large scale economic simulation

## TODO

Based on common project requirements, these are the files that you will likely need to adjust:

backend/main.go: Configure CORS for your specific domains and set up proper route handling, including error handling.
backend/Dockerfile: Configure for multi-stage build to have a lean production image.
frontend/Dockerfile: Similarly, set up a multi-stage build for a production-ready frontend image.
docker-compose.yml: Update for any additional services, network definitions, or changes to existing services.
frontend/src/routes/Simulation/+page.svelte: Use environment variables for API endpoints rather than hardcoded URLs.
.gitignore: Make sure it includes all auto-generated files or directories that shouldn't be pushed to the repository.



Given the scope and complexity of the task, it's challenging to provide specific code modifications or debugging services directly in this format. However, I can provide you with recommendations and steps you might take to address issues in both the front-end and back-end parts of your application. Here's an overview of suggestions based on the files you've shared:

### Frontend Suggestions:

1. **Improve UI/UX**:
   - Consider using a UI library or design system, such as Tailwind CSS or Material UI, to streamline the design process.
   - Ensure that forms have validation feedback to guide users on required inputs.
   - Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigability).
   
2. **Code Clean-Up and Modularity**:
   - Break down large components into smaller, reusable ones.
   - Use a consistent styling approach, whether it's CSS modules, styled components, or inline styles.
   
3. **Performance**:
   - Optimize image sizes and use modern formats like WebP.
   - Lazy-load non-critical components.
   - Implement code-splitting for routes or heavy components.

4. **Application State Management**:
   - If your application scales and you find the need for global state management, consider using a state management library like Redux or Svelte's built-in store.
   
5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Avoid hard-coded URLs in component logic (`+page.svelte` and others). Use environment variables for your API endpoints and configure these based on different environments (development, staging, production).
   
6. **Testing**:
   - Ensure end-to-end tests (using Playwright) also cover various edge cases and failure states.
   - Implement unit and integration tests for critical application logic.
   
7. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling in network requests to inform users of failures in a user-friendly manner.

8. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Determine a caching strategy for your API requests. This might involve service workers, local storage, or in-memory caching.

### Backend Suggestions:

1. **Code Quality and Organization**:
   - Consider organizing your Go code into packages by feature rather than by type (e.g., `simulation`, `redis`, etc.).
   
2. **Authentication and Security**:
   - If not already implemented, add authentication and authorization middleware to protect your endpoints.
   - Ensure sensitive data is properly handled and encrypted if necessary.
   
3. **Data Validation**:
   - Ensure that all incoming data is properly validated to avoid injection attacks or processing invalid data.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement structured logging and consider an observability solution for understanding the system state and diagnosing problems.
   
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Standardize error responses and ensure that they're user-friendly and provide sufficient detail for debugging.
   
6. **Docker Optimization**:
   - Optimize the backend Dockerfile for a multi-stage build to reduce the final image size.

7. **API Documentation**:
   - Use tools like Swagger or Redoc to document your API. This provides clarity on how to consume your API and what is expected of the client.

8. **Configuration and Secrets Management**:
   - Ensure that configuration and secrets are managed securely, possibly using environment variables or configuration management tools.

Before proceeding with these changes, review your project's requirements, and determine what updates align best with your goals. If you agree with these suggestions or have specific issues you'd like to address, we can dive deeper into actionable steps for each recommendation.
