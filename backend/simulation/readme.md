# D&D World Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates various aspects of a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) world, focusing on economic factors and character skills. It aims to provide a dynamic and interactive environment for understanding how different elements like resource availability, market demand, political stability, and character abilities interact and evolve over time.

## Structure
The project is organized into several Go files, each handling a specific aspect of the simulation:

- `character_skills.go`: Defines the structure and methods for character skills like crafting ability and negotiation.
- `economic_factors.go`: Handles the economic aspects of the simulation, including resource availability, market demand, and political stability.
- `simulation.go`: The main logic for running the simulation, combining economic factors and character skills.
- `simulation_params.go`: Defines the parameters used in the simulation, ensuring they are correctly initialized and validated.
- `simulation_result.go`: Structures the outcome of each simulation run.
